        - This month-long project covered an absurd amount of content.\n                We were tasked to create what is essentially a bash clone. The\n                lexical analysis was done using <strong>flex and bison</strong>,\n                where I tokenized certain inputs using regular expressions,\n                executing different code based on what was inputted.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                - <strong>File redirection</strong> was one of the first things\n                that I tackled, so I learned all about juggling file descriptors\n                to do so. <strong>Piping</strong> was a bit different than file\n                descriptors - we had to use the pipe() system call and\n                read/write to/from the pipe to communicate between different\n                parts of the command.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                - The next section covered{\" \"}\n                <strong>signals and signal handling</strong>. Specifically, we\n                set up handlers for ctrl-C (terminate command), ctrl-R (search\n                command history), and SIGCHLD (zombie process elimination).\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                - One of the most challenging parts of this project was\n                implementing <strong>subshells</strong>. For this, we had to\n                fork a new process, and use two different pipes to communicate\n                with it in order to get the output of the desired command. This\n                proved difficult to debug because of the fact that two processes\n                were being run.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                - We also used regular expressions and directory browsing to\n                implement <strong>wildcarding</strong>. We handled wildcarding\n                for '*' and '?'.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                - One smaller part of this project was{\" \"}\n                <strong>decoding raw input</strong>, rather than canonical\n                input. I was able to allow the user to type as they normally\n                would with bash. Specifically, I handled left arrow, right\n                arrow, delete (and ctrl-D), backspace (and ctrl-H), home (and\n                ctrl-A), and end (and ctrl-E).\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                - The last part of this project was to implement{\" \"}\n                <strong>command history and ctrl-R searching</strong>. Command\n                history was pretty straightforward, and I ended up imitating\n                bash's ctrl-R searching mode.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n            <li>\n              <h4>\n                <strong>Memory Allocator in C</strong>\n              </h4>\n            </li>\n            <p>\n              - This large project taught me the inner workings of memory\n              allocation. I created a program that has functionality for\n              malloc(), free(), realloc(), and calloc(). The main, most\n              difficult parts were managing large blocks of heap memory obtained\n              by sbrk() to avoid over-allocation and fragmentation of memory.\n              Multiple different block-finding methods were implemented - first\n              fit, best fit, worst fit, and next fit.\n            </p>\n            <li>\n              <h4>\n                <strong>Sudoku Solver in C++</strong>\n              </h4>\n              <li>\n                <p>\n                  - During my 2019-2020 Winter break, I decided to teach myself\n                  C++, and challenge myself with a project that I had no idea\n                  how to start.\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  - I bought a sudoku book and began completing puzzles to get a\n                  good idea of how these puzzles could be solved algorithmically\n                  with as little guessing as possible - I ended up implementing\n                  5 different algorithms, which helped me complete around 40-50%\n                  of boards that I threw at it. The challenge, though, was the\n                  rest of the boards\n                </p>\n                <p>\n                  - To finish everything else off, I implemented a recursive\n                  brute force algorithm. Basically, the idea was, when the\n                  program got stuck, solve a random Cell with a random\n                  candidate, then go on as usual. If the program got stuck\n                  again, it would recurse again, choosing another random value\n                  for another random Cell. If there were any unsolved Cells with\n                  no candidates, that brute force attempt failed, and another\n                  random candidate from the original Cell was chosen. If all\n                  candidates from that Cell failed, the board is unsolvable.\n                </p>\n              </li>\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              <h4>\n                <strong>HTTP/HTTPS Multithreaded Web Server in C</strong>\n              </h4>\n            </li>\n            <p>\n              - This assignment gave me valuable introductory networking\n              information. We first learned about HTTP request/response formats.\n              To give my server some security, I learned about basic\n              authentication using the 'Authorization' header. I also ended up\n              being able to serve static and executable files to the client.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              - One of the more important parts of this server was learning\n              about different types of <strong>concurrent processing</strong>.\n              The server that I created supported concurrency through forking,\n              threading, and using a thread pool for each request. Using mutexes\n              I made sure that the server was thread safe.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              - Due to this project,{\" \"}\n              <strong>\n                I am very comfortable with semaphores, mutexes, forking, and\n                threading.\n              </strong>\n            </p>\n            <li>\n              <h4>\n                <strong>Unix Task Manager in C</strong>\n              </h4>\n            </li>\n            <p>\n              - During this group project, I was assigned to explore and\n              understand what goes on in /proc on a Unix system, and pulled\n              information such as system information, process name, PID, process\n              resources, disk size, and disk usage. From there, I put the\n              information into easily-accessible structs for the front-end team\n              to handle.\n            </p>\n            <li>\n              <h4>\n                <strong>\n                  Twistter (Twister + Reddit Crossover) in Javascript (ReactJS)\n                </strong>\n              </h4>\n            </li>\n            <p>\n              - This group project focused on the SCRUM philosophy of software\n              development and making a full-fledged application. I was assigned\n              to the front end team, since I already knew ReactJS, and did an\n              extremely large majority of the work for the front end. I learned\n              how to communicate with the back end Python Flask API using\n              'axios' GET/POST calls, and made a dynamically-updated GUI for the\n              user. I am most proud of creating a login/logout functionality, as\n              well as a Direct Messaging system between users. The most\n              difficult part was updating the GUI based on who is logged in.\n            </p>\n            <li>\n              <h4>\n                <strong>NLP Database Parsing in Python</strong>\n              </h4>\n            </li>\n            <p>\n              - During the Summer of 2019, I had the pleasure of working for the\n              Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division. I improved US Navy\n              missile sustainment efforts by upgrading an existing natural\n              language processing algorithm to process failure databases.

I\n              isolated each base 10 digit and printed it, but it was much\n              tougher than %x since base 10 is not a multiple of 2, so bit\n              shifting is not possible.\n            </p>\n            <li>\n              <h4>\n                <strong>Ubuntu Tweaking</strong>\n              </h4>\n            </li>\n            <p>\n              - One of my main hobbies is tweaking and maintaining Ubuntu on my\n              laptop, which is a great way for me to learn more about how Unix\n              works.
