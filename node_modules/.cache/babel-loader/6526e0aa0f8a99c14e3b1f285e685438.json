I improved US Navy\n              missile sustainment efforts by upgrading an existing natural\n              language processing algorithm to process failure databases. The\n              work that I contributed to has a patent pending as well.\n            </p>\n            <li>\n              <h4>\n                <strong>printf() from scratch in ARM Assembly</strong>\n              </h4>\n            </li>\n            <p>\n              - In my Computer Architecture course, we had to implement\n              functionality for{\" \"}\n              <strong>printf()'s %c, %s, %d, and %x in ARM Assembly</strong>. %c\n              and %s were accomplished using looping and putchar(). %x was a bit\n              more difficult - I used bit shifting to isolate 4 bits, translated\n              into a hex digit, and print the hex digit. %d was the toughest. I\n              isolated each base 10 digit and printed it, but it was much\n              tougher than %x since base 10 is not a multiple of 2, so bit\n              shifting is not possible.\n            </p>\n            <li>\n              <h4>\n                <strong>Ubuntu Tweaking</strong>\n              </h4>\n            </li>\n            <p>\n              - One of my main hobbies is tweaking and maintaining Ubuntu on my\n              laptop, which is a great way for me to learn more about how Unix\n              works. I enjoy customizing my workflow for efficiency, using a\n              tiling window manager (i3) and a task bar (polybar). The dot files\n              for these are on my GitHub.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              - I have written numerous bash scripts to automate some mundane\n              tasks, and heavily customized my .vimrc and .bashrc. I have also\n              written a pair of scripts that helps me maintain my Ubuntu setup\n              between computers. One of them automatically pulls the most recent\n              dotfiles off of my computer and pushes them to GitHub. The other\n              one automatically pulls the most recent dotfiles off of GitHub and\n              puts them in the right place.\n            </p>\n            <li>\n              <h4>\n                <strong>DNS Level Adblocker</strong>\n              </h4>\n            </li>\n            <p>\n              - Once I completed my Computer Architecture course, I had a\n              Raspberry PI 3B+ left over, so I decided to download a program\n              called PiHole. This program functions as a DNS server for your\n              home network, so I redirected all of my router's traffic to the\n              Pi. It uses a database of malicious/intrusive host names to block\n              them before they even reach your device. I particularly like it\n              because it blocks advertisements AND trackers.\n            </p>\n          </ul>\n          <br />\n          <br />\n          <br />\n          <br />\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
